This project is based in another one that teach me a lot, and that is: https://github.com/Alaricus/clicker-tutorial-react

I recommend to take a look of it and give it the proper congrats that its deserves. 

For know it only has a frontend and "re-initialice" to his original state after every restart of the server, but with time it will have a login/register system and a backend to store sessions, data and JWT validation. That's all for know <3
